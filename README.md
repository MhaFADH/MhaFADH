# Welcome

I'm a 4th-year student currently completing a Master's degree in Fullstack Development.  
I work across web, mobile, and embedded systems, with a focus on understanding how things work — both in software and hardware.

### Focus Areas

I'm particularly interested in cars and car mechanics.  
I often repair and work on my own vehicle and others, as a way to learn and explore how systems are designed and built. This curiosity naturally led me to embedded systems and automotive technologies.

Currently learning and applying:

-  CAN bus communication
-  ESP32 modules
-  Real-time operating systems: FreeRTOS, Zephyr RTOS
-  Low-level systems design and architecture

To apply this knowledge, I’m building small projects such as:

-  A CAN bus sniffer/reader
-  Parking sensor system
-  Diagnostic tools

These are learning-focused projects, which I plan to rebuild on different RTOS platforms to explore how they behave under varying design constraints.

**Long-term goal:** to work in the automotive industry, applying and expanding my knowledge in embedded systems and vehicle technologies.

### Web & Mobile Development

Alongside embedded work, I also build web and mobile applications.  
I value clarity, maintainability, and practical design. My approach to development is problem-oriented and focused on building reliable tools and systems.
