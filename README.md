# 👋 Welcome

I'm a 4th-year student currently completing a Master's degree in Fullstack Development.  
I work across web, mobile, and embedded systems, with a focus on understanding how things work — both in software and hardware.

### ⚙️ Focus Areas

I'm particularly interested in cars and car mechanics.  
I often repair and work on my own vehicle and others, as a way to learn and explore how systems are designed and built. This curiosity naturally led me to embedded systems and automotive technologies.

Currently learning and applying:

- 🧩 CAN bus communication
- 📡 ESP32 modules
- ⏱️ Real-time operating systems: FreeRTOS, Zephyr RTOS
- 🧠 Low-level systems design and architecture

To apply this knowledge, I’m building small projects such as:

- 🛠️ A CAN bus sniffer/reader
- 📍 Parking sensor system
- 🔧 Diagnostic tools

These are learning-focused projects, which I plan to rebuild on different RTOS platforms to explore how they behave under varying design constraints.

🎯 **Long-term goal:** to work in the automotive industry, applying and expanding my knowledge in embedded systems and vehicle technologies.

### 💻 Web & Mobile Development

Alongside embedded work, I also build web and mobile applications.  
I value clarity, maintainability, and practical design. My approach to development is problem-oriented and focused on building reliable tools and systems.
